Coversions between ascii, binary, hex
Hex to Binary
xD1A3 to binary
13 1 10 3
b1101 0001 1010 0011
29 to unsigned
b11101

-29 to 2's compliment
b11101
b00010
b00011

Actual exponent = biased exponent -127
math
1) Both numbers have to have the same number of bits (sign extend if they don't)
2) overflow: Happens when adding 2 same signed numbers and recult is larger than
can be stored in range

Sequential vs combinational logic

Boolean algebra
And/OR
A and A = A
A and NA = 0
A and 1 = A
A and 0 = 0

A or A = A
A or NA = 1
A or 1 = 1
A or 0 = A
